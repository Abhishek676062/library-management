2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd library-management

3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate # On Windows, use env\Scripts\activate

4. Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Set up the MongoDB connection in `database.py` by replacing the placeholders with your actual MongoDB Atlas credentials and cluster information.

## Running the Application
